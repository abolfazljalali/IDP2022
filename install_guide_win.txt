Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.10.8 in PATH - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3108/
2. MySQL server with database "image_gallery" - upload /src/ui/image_gallery.sql into it

If you install XAMPP, add XAMPP's PHP interpreter to PATH ! (look at video)


Steps:
1. Run install_win.bat to initialize venv, install Python libraries and initialize Django
The installer will ask you to create credentials for super user - create them carefully!
2. Run test_win.bat to run automated tests (optional)
3. Run start_django_win.bat to start the Django server
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/admin
5. Authenticate with credentials you have created during installation
6. Navigate to Frontal / File Formats model
7. If the model is empty, add two objects: "tif" and ".tif"
8. In browser, navigate to http://localhost:8000/frontal/image/insert
9. Insert some images
10. Run start_ui_win.bat

You can navigate through UI in PHP at http://localhost:3000/
